### Runcam 5

The SQ12 mount is a rework of a mount I already made. However, this version has an updated base. A different version is already available on [github](https://github.com/nuxnik/tyro79-sq12-mount) and also as a printable STL file on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4700483)
